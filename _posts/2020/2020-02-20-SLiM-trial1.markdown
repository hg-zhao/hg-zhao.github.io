I will start practice with SLiM 

Below is the note (from Matt) and goals,

Goal: to estimate power to detect delta_p for a given starting p after within-generation challenge

I need 

1. sampling ind from pop, applying selection, sequencing & comparing n chromosomes before vs after

2. burn in population to equilibrium

3. subdivide population into groups of 300 - starting samples

4. output "before" chromosomes, 2n --> mut, bin by freqs ("starting freq")

5. apply 80% selection

6. output "after" chromosomes, 2n --> mut, delta_p

Questions:

1. what % of nonneutral mutations (of a given start_p and QTL effect size) are significant at 5% level?

2. how long of a burn in is needed to establish low LD? Use high recomb rate?

Quant Trait Factors:

1. s selection strength (% mortality)

2. h heritability

3. genetic architecture (QTL effect sizes, distribution)

4. equilibrium LD 

Notes (from Ben):

1. nonWF model has easier structure for sampling chromosomes before and after viability selection within gen

2. need to empirically determine % mortality from a given selection model

3. burn in for wild population includes neutral, so large population might require tree-seq recording

4. selected QTL are also burning in, but that is often fast

5. stabilizing selection often maintains very little variation at QTL at equilibrium -
	NEED wide Gaussian function
	or lots of small effect loci

6. should be okay to model high recomb rates to lower eq LD, but may still need large N to get low enough LD

#### How to specify the mutation type

Mutation types might represent things like neutral mutations, beneficial mutations, deleterious mutations, nearly neutral mutations, etc., with different distributions of fitness effects. 

Function: 

initializeMutationType(“m1”, 0.5, “f”,0.0), which means the model simulates a m1 mutation with fixed distribution of fitness effect (DFE) of 0.0.  Here is 0.5 means a dominance coefficient for this mutation type.

A brief note about [dominance coefficient](http://www.uvm.edu/~dstratto/bcor102/readings/0_MutationSelectionBalance.pdf) 

DFE could be 

1. normal - e.g. “n”, 0.0, 0.1 (0.0 is the mean while 0.1 is standard deviation) 

2. fixed - e.g. “f”, 0.0

3. dominance coefficient with exponential DFE - e.g. “e”, 0.1; it draws its selection coefficients from an exponential distribution (‘e’) with a mean of 0.1

4. dominance coefficient with gamma DFE - e.g. “g”, -0.03, 0.2; it draws its selection coefficients from a gamma distribution (‘g’) with a mean of -0.03 and a shape parameter of 0.2. Note, gamma distribution cannot have a negative mean, but here “-“ means that the distribution has a mean of 0.03, while the sign of each drawn value is flipped.

Three mutation examples:

Neutral or non-coding regions: initializeMutationType(“m1”, 0.5, “f”, 0.0)

Beneficial: initializeMutationType(“m2”, 0.1, “e”, 0.1)

Deleterious: initializeMutationType(“m3”, 0.2, “g”, -0.03, 0.2)
